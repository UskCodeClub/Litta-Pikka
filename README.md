#Litta Pikka

This is a project to encourage the children of Usk Primary to pick up litter. The idea is that the children weigh the litter they collect and then enter the weight of litter collected against the school house they are in. When litter is entered a tweet is sent out with the house name and amount of litter collected to encourage other children to also collect litter. Each time the children enter litter they earn dojos for their house.
